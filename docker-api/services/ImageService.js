/**
* Build an image
* Build an image from a tar archive with a `Dockerfile` in it.  The `Dockerfile` specifies how the image is built from the tar archive. It is typically in the archive's root, but can be at a different path or have a different name by specifying the `dockerfile` parameter. [See the `Dockerfile` reference for more information](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).  The Docker daemon performs a preliminary validation of the `Dockerfile` before starting the build, and returns an error if the syntax is incorrect. After that, each instruction is run one-by-one until the ID of the new image is output.  The build is canceled if the client drops the connection by quitting or being killed. 
*
* dockerfile String Path within the build context to the `Dockerfile`. This is ignored if `remote` is specified and points to an external `Dockerfile`. (optional)
* t String A name and optional tag to apply to the image in the `name:tag` format. If you omit the tag the default `latest` value is assumed. You can provide several `t` parameters. (optional)
* extrahosts String Extra hosts to add to /etc/hosts (optional)
* remote String A Git repository URI or HTTP/HTTPS context URI. If the URI points to a single text file, the fileâ€™s contents are placed into a file called `Dockerfile` and the image is built from that file. If the URI points to a tarball, the file is downloaded by the daemon and the contents therein used as the context for the build. If the URI points to a tarball and the `dockerfile` parameter is also specified, there must be a file with the corresponding path inside the tarball. (optional)
* q Boolean Suppress verbose build output. (optional)
* nocache Boolean Do not use the cache when building the image. (optional)
* cachefrom String JSON array of images used for build cache resolution. (optional)
* pull String Attempt to pull the image even if an older image exists locally. (optional)
* rm Boolean Remove intermediate containers after a successful build. (optional)
* forcerm Boolean Always remove intermediate containers, even upon failure. (optional)
* memory Integer Set memory limit for build. (optional)
* memswap Integer Total memory (memory + swap). Set as `-1` to disable swap. (optional)
* cpushares Integer CPU shares (relative weight). (optional)
* cpusetcpus String CPUs in which to allow execution (e.g., `0-3`, `0,1`). (optional)
* cpuperiod Integer The length of a CPU period in microseconds. (optional)
* cpuquota Integer Microseconds of CPU time that the container can get in a CPU period. (optional)
* buildargs String JSON map of string pairs for build-time variables. Users pass these values at build-time. Docker uses the buildargs as the environment context for commands run via the `Dockerfile` RUN instruction, or for variable expansion in other `Dockerfile` instructions. This is not meant for passing secret values.  For example, the build arg `FOO=bar` would become `{\"FOO\":\"bar\"}` in JSON. This would result in the query parameter `buildargs={\"FOO\":\"bar\"}`. Note that `{\"FOO\":\"bar\"}` should be URI component encoded.  [Read more about the buildargs instruction.](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg)  (optional)
* shmsize Integer Size of `/dev/shm` in bytes. The size must be greater than 0. If omitted the system uses 64MB. (optional)
* squash Boolean Squash the resulting images layers into a single layer. *(Experimental release only.)* (optional)
* labels String Arbitrary key/value labels to set on the image, as a JSON map of string pairs. (optional)
* networkmode String Sets the networking mode for the run commands during build. Supported standard values are: `bridge`, `host`, `none`, and `container:<name|id>`. Any other value is taken as a custom network's name or ID to which this container should connect to.  (optional)
* contentType String  (optional)
* xRegistryConfig String This is a base64-encoded JSON object with auth configurations for multiple registries that a build may refer to.  The key is a registry URL, and the value is an auth configuration object, [as described in the authentication section](#section/Authentication). For example:  ``` {   \"docker.example.com\": {     \"username\": \"janedoe\",     \"password\": \"hunter2\"   },   \"https://index.docker.io/v1/\": {     \"username\": \"mobydock\",     \"password\": \"conta1n3rize14\"   } } ```  Only the registry domain name (and port if not the default 443) are required. However, for legacy reasons, the Docker Hub registry must be specified with both a `https://` prefix and a `/v1/` suffix even though Docker will prefer to use the v2 registry API.  (optional)
* platform String Platform in the format os[/arch[/variant]] (optional)
* target String Target build stage (optional)
* outputs String BuildKit output configuration (optional)
* version String Version of the builder backend to use.  - `1` is the first generation classic (deprecated) builder in the Docker daemon (default) - `2` is [BuildKit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit)  (optional)
* inputStream File A tar archive compressed with one of the following algorithms: identity (no compression), gzip, bzip2, xz. (optional)
* no response value expected for this operation
